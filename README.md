# library-borrowing-system
## Description

The program aims to provide a tool borrowing system using c# which can be divided into two parts. One is menu, the other is classes which are Tool, ToolCollection, Member and MemberCollection class. The menu provides a simple interface for users interacting with the program. Turning to classes, the ToolCollection class uses an array of Tool object to store the tool objects. For MemberCollection, I use a hastable of Member class to store the member objects.
